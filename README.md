# Data Structure Classification Task

## Classification from Course Notes


We have provided separate code files for each classification type:

### 1. Linear Data Structures
* **Static (Array):** Located in `array_static.py`. Used for fixed datasets.
* **Dynamic (Linked List):** Located in `linked_list_dynamic.py`. Used for memory flexibility.
* **Dynamic (Stack):** Located in `stack_dynamic.py`. Used for LIFO operations.
* **Dynamic (Queue):** Located in `queue_dynamic.py`. Used for FIFO operations.

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
* **Tree:** Located in `tree_nonlinear.py`. Used for hierarchical data.
* **Graph:** Located in `graph_nonlinear.py`. Used for interconnected networks.

## Research: Applications & Reasons
* **Array:** Used in **Image Processing** because pixels are stored in fixed grids (Static).
* **Linked List:** Used in **Music Players** for playlists (Dynamic insertion).
* **Stack:** Used in **Browsers** for the "Back" button (Undo logic).
* **Queue:** Used in **Printer Buffers** (First job in, first job out).
* **Tree:** Used in **HTML DOM** (Hierarchy of a website).
* **Graph:** Used in **Social Networks** like Facebook (Mapping friends).

## How DSA Works Within Systems
Data structures determine how data is stored in memory (RAM), while algorithms determine how fast that data is processed. Efficient DSA choices prevent system crashes and ensure the CPU can handle millions of requests per second.
